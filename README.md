# Installation
To interface with Remix, we need to install npm and the latest remixd package (which interfaces with remix.ethereum). To do this, follow directions at https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixd.html or type
`npm install -g @remix-project/remixd`.  If you're out of date, perhaps try `npm uninstall -g remixd` first.
